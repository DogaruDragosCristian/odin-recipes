    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These traditional sarmals are not missing from Romanians' Holiday tables. Sarmals are made for Christmas, New Year, the celebration of different saints and even Easter (in some areas). The most beloved Romanian sarmăluțe are the ones with minced pork (or pork-beef mix), wrapped in thin sheets of sauerkraut.

        Traditional Moldavian sarmales are made very small, they contain chopped greens (dill, green parsley) and are boiled with broth or tomato juice. They are served with warm polenta.
